In this project, we present the Risk Budgeting method for portfolio optimization.

The objective of this method is to allocate asset weights so that each asset achieves a specified contribution to the portfolioâ€™s overall risk.

Specifically :
            - **Equally Weighted Portfolio (EWP)**: Assets have the same weight but contribute differently to the portfolioâ€™s total volatility.
            - **Risk Parity Portfolio (RPP)**: Assets contribute equally to the portfolioâ€™s total volatility, although their weights may vary.
            
# ðŸš€ Repository Structure

- **Images :**  The folder contains images used on the notebook. 
- **Theory:** A PDF document providing a detailed explanation of the theory behind the model.
- **Risk Parity.ipynb :** a notebook that details the risk parity method and compare it to the Equaly weighted portfolio.
